# Lab2: Memory Management
[guide link](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/labs/lab2/)
## Introduction
Writing memory management code for our OS, memory management have two components:
1. physical memory allocator for kernel, so that the kernel can allocate memory and later free it.
2. virtual memory, which maps the virtual address used by kernel and user software to address in physical memory.

## Getting started
```sh
cd lab 
git checkout -b lab2 origin/lab2
```
## Part 1: Physical Page Management

JOS manages the PC's physical memory with `page` granularity, and use the MMU to map and protect each piece of allocated memory.

Let's review this booting process. OS loads the bootsector to 0x7c00 first sets the environment, then call to bootmain in c code. bootmain loads the kernel and call into kernel entry. Kernel loads entry_pgdir to cr3 to enable Paging, then call `i386_init`. i386_init Clear the BSS, call `cons_init()` to set up the screen display device and making it ready for cprintf to run, then call `mem_init()`. Finally call `monitor()` to interact with users.

Before calling to i386_int(), the memory distribution is shown in the figure below:

Now need to write **physical page allocator**, which keeps track of which pages are free with a linked list of `struct Pageinfo` objects(`memlayout.h` line 175). A object corresponding to a physical page.

### Exercise 1
In the file `kern/pmap.c`, you must implement code for the following functions (probably in the order given).
> 
> boot_alloc()
> 
> mem_init() (only up to the call to check_page_free_list(1))
> 
> page_init()
> 
> page_alloc()
> 
> page_free()
> 
> check_page_free_list() and check_page_alloc() test your physical page allocator. 

**boot_alloc()**

boot_alloc() use a magic symbol `end` to get BSS tail which pointe to first free memory.

`ROUNDUP(n, M)` returns a num that satisfy `num % M == 0 && M >= num >= n`

```c
boot_alloc(uint32_t n)
{
	static char *nextfree;	// virtual address of next byte of free memory
	char *result;

	// Initialize nextfree if this is the first time.
	// 'end' is a magic symbol automatically generated by the linker,
	// which points to the end of the kernel's bss segment:
	// the first virtual address that the linker did *not* assign
	// to any kernel code or global variables.
	if (!nextfree) {
		extern char end[];
		nextfree = ROUNDUP((char *) end, PGSIZE);	// round end up to PGSIZE
	}

	// Allocate a chunk large enough to hold 'n' bytes, then update
	// nextfree.  Make sure nextfree is kept aligned
	// to a multiple of PGSIZE.
	//
	// LAB 2: Your code here.
	if(n == 0)
		return nextfree;		// if n == 0, return nextfree, not allocate any memory.
	result = nextfree;
	nextfree += ROUNDUP(n, PGSIZE);		// align to PGSIZE
	return nextfree;
}
```
